Gitneat is a small CLI application for initializing local &amp; remote repositories. Some of the added benefits of using Gitneat over the traditional `git init`:
- Automatically creates a remote repository linked to your local repo
- Creates a gitignore, which you can either populate by selecting files or use one of the Github templates
